    Generating ideas for a new project can be a difficult and stressful process, and throughout years, we each develop our own ways and techniques tackling this challenge. There's been thousands of books and various writings by authors who feel they have achieved a reliable technique that could work for others. I believe we are all different and what might work for someone,  might not work for another. So, the best result we can hope for, is when we share our experiences and techniques, we get to learn from each other, and we get to adapt our own process rather than replace. Today's group exercise felt a lot like that. We each got to share our experiences not aiming for convincing others, but rather share with others and receive their response with a constructive environment. 

    I've been a designer for the longer part of my life and I've developed of formed my own process, which is influenced and inspired by several things from my own background. For example, the techniques that I get inspired by growing up as a creative person are still there, however, grew over time and matured through new experiences in life and with others, peers and teachers. 

    A common practice that is often used for generating ideas is sketching. I heard more than one person in my group mention sketching as a technique they use in order to visually observe their ideas and by extension generate new ideas. I personally use this technique often. I used to rely on sketching much more, but through experience, I learnt to be more efficient about it. For example, while before I used to sketch 50 or 60 different sketches, in variety of complexity, for a project and then use a method of elimination in order to get to the best result. While this may work for some projects, sketching for such a long time can be a waste of time, so, I adapt my process to involve a little more research and ideation, and then move to sketching stage that would require significantly less time and effort. 

    Since my childhood, I have always been a "fixer". Going from taking old radios and electronics apart and attempting to assemble them again, I quickly gained the confidence to attempt to fix any malfunctioning electronic device at home. After that, I worked in my uncle electronics repair shop and spent most afternoons learning and fixing electronics. While I did not learn these skills using any books of formal teaching, my brain got comfortable with this type learning and doing. Until today, I rely on my improvisation abilities when learning new skills and tools, and in most cases, I quickly pick up the new challenge. 

    Throughout my teenage, I spent most weekends of the sow and harvest seasons helping my grandfather, who's a farmer, in his farm. Spending time with farmers allowed me to observe and appreciate the way they treat their assets, especially equipment. This experience taught me that tools are important, and that tools can be utilized in many different ways, and in many cases, they can outlast their owner. In the farm, we throw nothing, we recycle everything, and if we cannot recycle it, we repurpose it. For example, when my grandmother wanted to throw away the old washing machine, we moved it to the farm, and there, my uncle was able to turn it to a small hydro-generator. Genius, yet doable. 

    Understanding our experiences in our childhood and young adult life, we can decode and analyze our skills and our weaknesses. While I recognize my skills in making through improvising, or resourceful and multidisciplinary thinking, I also am able to identify foundational weaknesses like extensive literal research and writing. These, while not required in all disciplines, are vital to be able to formulate, present and defend a research thesis paper and project.

    Deciding what type of prototype would be beneficial for a thesis project is essential for the research journey to be completed and relevant. In today's class, we went over the types of prototypes that we can consider for our thesis research and projects and since each research is a subject matter, we each find value in different prototypes for this specific journey. For example, examining my research topic and the message I want my audience to get from this project, I have to break down and analyze what each type of prototype can do for this project and how it can benefit me and the audience. 

    E-waste is a massive issue, and I personally will not aim or propose how to solve it. However, my exploration will allow me to understand how I can be part of this solution and my experience and journey will be intended to inspire the audience to figure out their own steps in order to be part of the solution. Hence, the type of prototype I decide to go with will be absolutely essential to the audience and to the message. For example, a low-fidelity prototype, while it allows me to experiment extensively with several ideas and concepts, it might seem unattractive to the audience. Also, low-fidelity prototypes allows for the message to be abstract, or hidden, rather than visible and clear. In my case, I believe I need to build several low-fidelity prototypes in order to understand and decide what kind of message and how to deliver that message. 

    On other hand, a high-fidelity prototype, while inline with my style and interests, requires extensive knowledge and effort to perfect and ensure looks good and attractive. However, it will attract audience and is more likely to have an effect on them than a low-fidelity one. This type of prototype is what I'm interested in for a final delivery, because I believe in the aesthetics of things and I believe people are too. Also, the message intended to be delivered requires a fully-functional object that does what it is supposed to do, otherwise, it can still be considered junk that people might throw in the trash, or in their old electronics drawer. 

    An outcome centred prototype seems like the sweet-spot between the first two types. An outcome centred prototype requires the building of several low-fidelity prototypes, however, with the intention of figuring out and perfecting the final prototype which will be delivered and presented. This seems like what would work in my project. Using this method, I get the chance to use my prototype building journey, as a research or exploration, into what will be delivered in the future. A process of exploration can be very beneficial to the project because the designer gets to explore every possible outcome and every possible implication of their decisions without the need to wait until the last step of the process. Definitely a process more inline with my personal process and more inline with my intended outcome for this project. 

    A process centred prototype is also a very attached solution to my project. This type of prototype allows for the explorations and the outcomes to be recorded and used in the research section of the thesis. While it might offer some benefits to my project, this method is more research-focused than object-focused, which is where I intend to focus my thesis. However, I do plan to utilize some of the approaches in this method in order to refine my research and add some personal contribution to the thesis research document. 

    A context-centred approach is a big-picture approach. A very beneficial method in order to keep the audience focused on the general idea rather than dive into small more specific ideas, which might confuse the audience. 

    While I intend to use some of those approaches through my thesis research and project, I find it very useful to know about them in order to know which ones to avoid.

    Presenting our initial prototype ideas was very helpful in understanding and structuring what is to be expected and aimed for during this class. Having access to professional and peer review, to present and listen to feedback is vital, especially because it is the first one we receive so far. So, after presenting a couple of ideas I had for the prototype, I received some confusion regarding the concept and it required additional explanation. This is very helpful for me since a practical thesis should be explainable in one sentence, which is a work-in-progress until now. 

    My aim for this prototype is not to build something challenging or new. My aim was much more basic than that at this point. Starting the exploratin into what kind of object will successfully compliment my thesis research is going to be full mistakes and experimentation. So, I don't expect to get it right from the first time, nor the second, probably not even the third, and listening to my peers' own explorations confirmed my choice. So, for this prototype I decided to choose from three options: A. The first idea is an electronic dice device that is used in countless boardgames. It is not the most advanced or new idea, but I want to experiment with the playfulness of this project and possible explore a less serious more fun approach to creation and recycling. B. The second idea I proposed is a stereo system recycled from discarded audio devices like speakers and car radios. Although this idea is not as playful as the first, it does however, bring music into the project, which another big interest of mine. C. The third idea is an LED matrix compiled from several different discarded devices' LEDs and put together to create a visual experience that can continuously remind the viewer of e-waste. 

    Although non of the ideas is presenting something new or never-been-done-before. However, they do offer a simple and elegant presentation of the problem and a possible solution. Design is essential in the world today. Designers can have an amazing impact on the long run. We continue to see today, evidence and implications of design decisions made several generations ago, for example, the Star, developed by Xerox, has impacted the way we interact and view computers today. The concept of a desktop, a mouse, a keyboard, etc were all introduced by Xerox in the early 80s, and it was a design experiment, that might or might not be the best way to design a computer interface. So, bearing that in mind, we have to acknowledge the influence design can have on the world and start using the skills and advantages of design-thinking to create speculative solutions for the future. 

    I noticed some of the remarks I received regarding my prototype, was a the futuristic remark. While most student proposed AR or VR or hologram etc, which are futuristic technologies, I wanted to refocus my study to a different futuristic view, one that does not necessarily take the status-quo as acceptable, and attempts to propose a different one. A research and building venture that can refine our relationship with technology to a healthier one or atleast help some of us identify it. My view of the future is not a world full of AR and wearables and gadgets only, but it is also the mountains of waste all of those gadgets will be one day.

    Deciding on what prototype to build in this stage presents a great challenge and a meaningful opportunity to explore a direction for my thesis journey and be able to receive feedback from real users that would help me focus or change that direction if necessary at an early stage. Thats why it was vital for me to choose the most impactful option and try to show as much as possible. Thats also why I chose to go with the stereo system made from recyclable materials. First, it allows me to play with something I am passionate about, music, and second, it also allows me to use my skills in fabrication within my thesis concept. In addition to that, the stereo present a healthy challenge for me at this point, because I'm not too sure I want to spend the time and effort required for physical computing a this point, especially without gauging the impact any of my objects will have on the audience within my thesis topic. 

    A stereo system will also be able to connect with people because everyone uses them and everyone likes good music. However, finding the necessary components will be challenging because this is my first attempt at finding used and discarded components. I personally have kept a few items at my home that I chose to use for this project, which are: computer speakers, audio amplifier and an old ikea shelving unit that was broken and unusable.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    In order for me to begin working on a project this scale, I find it useful to build a miniature prototype that helps me understand the shapes and the scales I'm working with, and also helps me understand the best way to interact with that object. So, after my initial sketches, I quickly moved into the miniature stage, and with the help of the laser machine, I cut miniature replicas of the wooden parts I needed to built the module. So, after building it, I started to studying it carefully. It took me 2 days to come to the conclusion that the shapes and the sizes I decided to go with were too big and the relation between the multiple objects was not working out. So, I started to consider new directions to go that would fit into the timeframe I had left to finish this prototype. 

    The problems I learned from the miniature prototype was that choosing to work with 3 various sizes boxes is first, wasteful because I did not need that much space inside, second, extremely difficult to move, third, and most importantly, did not look interactive, or inviting. It looked like 3 static boxes sitting beside each other, and will be too heavy for someone to constantly move around and replace. Also, because I was considering to use magnets and conductive tape for connectivity between speakers, the shape of the objects allowed very little to be creative with the layout. 

    Although I was worried that my initial idea did not work, I was glad I built the miniature model at an early stage, which gave me enough time to reconsider and redirect where I want this project to go, and have enough time to built a clean prototype.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Finally, today I was able to finalize the shape for this prototype. Eventually, I decied to go with a very familiar shape for me, which is based on traditional coffee tables from the Levant areas in the Middle East. The shape is a hexagonal table-top, with legs stretching down from every side. On each side, there are intricate patterns that are usually inserted with shells that give various colors. A very popular item in traditional homes and one that is not usually thrown out after getting old.

    This was a great transition for my project because this relationship with the Middle East is also the inspiration for my thesis and the message behind it. Choosing the path of upcycling for the thesis project is directly related to the times I lived in Lebanon where upcycling of electronics is commong, especially in my family. This connection makes the prototype stronger and gives me strong direction to build it. 

    So, using that traditional coffee table as an inspiration quickly put me into a fast development stage, I quickly made the drawings and calculated the measurements. Today was a good day.

    On the parts side, at this point I have secured all the wood I need, through a few pieces I have kept at home, and the rest were recycled wood from the maker lab and around the building. I have also secured a subwoofer from an old bass amplifier, I tested it, and it was working. I also bought a used car amplifier for $15 from kijiji.com. To power this sculpture, I am planning to use a computer powersupply, which are very common in used computers stores. However, since this is my first attempt, I decided to purchase a brand new one, and learn the guide in order to know how to operate, and eventually how to hack it. The power supply provides plenty of 12V, but also 5V and 3.3V, which is great. I'm still looking for a stereo, but not sure about the connectivity. On one hand, using a car stereo makes sense, because it also requires 12V power supply and allows for easy connectivity for the users. However, I did not like that idea because car stereos are just like any other electronic device, they are quickly developing and making new ones every year and leave behind plenty of e-waste. It basically did not communicate my intended message about technology, and I had to change.

    Today, I was able to finally secure the rest of the parts I needed to finish this prototype. I decided to scrap the car stereo idea, and instead, my friend donated a used vinyl player that had a broken case. That was perfect for me, because vinyl represents a technology that has remained consistent and common even with the rise of more advanced and easier technology. It communicated my message perfectly. The only problem is I never owned one, and I did not know much about how it works and how to use it. I need to remove it from its case, and insert it somehow onto the scultpure. But so far, it solved several issues for me because I really did not like the car stereo idea, and I could not think of anything else.
    
    After removing the vinyl player from its case, I noticed the board it is mounted on by the manufacturer had a unique cut-out in the middle where the player fits perfectly. So, I decided to trace the shape of the cut-out and transfer it on the computer where I was able to convert it into a vector drawing and manipulate it in order to use it on the sculpture. Then, I ran it through the laser cutting machine and that worked perfectly. I was able to mount the vinyl player onto the top shelf of the scultpure and it fit perfectly. This was a major development because at the beginning of today, I was struggling with envisioning the car stereo within my scultpure because it visually and conceptually did not work well with the thesis focus. So, to end the day on a big win like this was great 
    
    As of now, I have all the parts that I needed to finish this sculpture.

<July.22.2019--Week-5--Entry-8-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Today was a long and productive day. I was able to quickly move through the process of fabrication. I cut the legs of the structure, each consisting of two pieces of wood cut in 30º angle and then stuck together to create a 60º angle for each corner of the hexagon. I was also able to make the table top from an old shelf and the bottom section from a used piece of wood in the maker lab. Everything was sanded and cleaned up, which made it look almost brand new. I've ran into some issues, mainly managing my time in order to complete the prototype ahead of time, also, a couple of ideas that I had planned are not working out once I started building. For example, I now realize that adding an inner panel to mount speakers and isolate their section, in addition to the outside panels, where the laser cut patterns are showing will add up to a very heavy sculpture that will be extremely challenging to move around, especially to the CFC retreat and back. Moreover, at some point, it just felt like too much wood, wasteful. So, I tweaked the direction a little in order to accomodate for eliminating the inner panels and just sticking to the outside ones with patterns. But, that meant I had consider changing the idea of using magnets as a mounting technique.  
    
    After building the chassis of the sculpture, I then took the power supply apart and removed all the plugs that I do not need. This meant I had to study the information sheet that came along with the power supply in order to know the differences between the colors and the safety precautions that I needed to know before embarking on this step. After identifying and isolating the colors of the voltages I need (yellow for 12V and black for GND), I cut the rest and covered all the exposed wire from the this process and safely secured it with shrink wire and electric tape. I installed the connection plugs that are required to safely connect the power supply to the amplifier. I tested the voltages and amps outputed by the power supply and made sure it is sufficient and safe for the vinyl player and the car amplifier. After, I completed building the circuit on a table and made sure all parts and connections are working before I soldered everything. 
    
    Once the soldering was done, I made all the necessary holes in the sculpture and mounted all the parts in their respective places. Through out this process, sometimes the plan set at the beginning worked out perfectly, and other times some improvistions were required in order to work around the challenges and speed bumps I faced. I learned a lot today, mostly about speakers, power supplies and some heavy tools.
    
    At this point, I am wondering that if I succeed in finishing this prototype in its first iteration, what room would it leave for iterations? Aiming to build a finished prototype will allow the audience to have an aesthetic experience, which is great, but I'm not sure if that will allow them to envision the concept expanded, which is essential for me at this point.

<July.23.2019--Week-5--Entry-9-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Today, i spent half of it on a laser cutting machine. On the scultpure side, I measured all the speakers and player to make the necessary cut outs using a laser cutting machine. After doing that, I installed the speakers and the middle section where the powersupply and the amplifier are attached to. The only thing left was the vinyl player, which I still did not take apart. After removing the cover and figuring out the shape that needs to be cut for this part to fit into, I ran it through the laser cutting machine and after a couple of failed attempts, I was finally able to install the vinyl player onto the sculpture. 

    Right now, I connected everything and its all working. However, I did not have enough time to run all the laser cut patterns through the machine and left the shop with only 2. Furthemore, I am a little worried that attempting to finish a prototype and then exhibiting an unfinished prototype doesn't communicate very well. I realize now the benefits of aiming to build a low-fidelity prototype from the beginning, rather than attempting at a high-fidelity and then showing a low-fidelity. For my next prototypes, I am convinced that I should take my time considering the benefits of low vs high fidelity prototypes and then selecting the most appropriate based on the goals I set for that prototype. 
    
    Although I am a little worried about showing an unfinished high-fidelity prototype, I do consider this as a learning experience that I am training my myself to be strategic with my goals and my plans, I do believe that I am identified a few points to work on and advance more. However, all in all, I'm happy with the result because it communicates the concept I developed for my thesis, which I believe is enough for this stage of the prorotype.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    The retreat went great. I received good feedback on the prototype, not all positive, but useful. I realized that my prototype was more refined than expected, which tends to impact people's reaction to it, and the way they perceive it. For example, people tend to expect more from a high-fidelity prototype and the object becomes a victim of its own success. So, building on that, It is absolutely vital for me to finish the prototype before our next presentation on Thursday. The feedback I received during the retreat was very useful, although some feedback had to be discarded (penetration) and others offered some good insights and inspirations to future steps. In other words, some feedback was not very useful because it could not see past the aesthetics of the object, and some were able to push that value of the object further, through very relevant suggestions.

    Although some feedback was not as useful, some helped focus the direction of my thesis study, and widened my options in terms of prototypes to create in the future. For example, the prototype's standalone feature was incomplete with out the additional information of the parts and the carpentry that went into it. So, to bridge that gap, I came up with the solution of using a customized QR code that encourages users to scan and follow through to a guidebook that will take them through the process step by step. Adding this feature sort of completes the concept. Without it, I needed to always be there and always repeat the building process in order to achieve the intended goal of the prototype. In addition to that, using a guidebook that is visually similar to the IKEA guidebooks is quickly perceived in a positive reaction because of its familiarity and ease. However, I am unsure between using a printed guidebook or a digital web-based guidebook that might resemble IKEA's less. Especially since I am talking about waste generally, the idea of printing a bunch of copies and giving them out to users is still uncomfortable for me and still requires more looking into.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Today was a good productive day. As of now, I am almost completely done with the second iteration of the prototype. I have a few front-facing boards to go through the laser cutting machine in order to cut the patterns I had designed on them. During this week, I have also added an additional frame on the top side of the table in order to offset the top to be alittle wider than the rest of the body. This makes the structure visually more stable and appealling. Also, this frame was necessary since it covered the gap between the inner chassis of the sculpture and the front-facing boards. 

    In addition to that, I have settled on creating a digital web-based guidebook that the users can get to by scanning a QR code laser cut on one of the front panels. Although the guidebook is in digital form, I decided to use a pdf format since in maintains a "page" look, which visually accomplishes the intended effect, and in addition to that, pdf provides low size files that are quickly loaded from an online hard drive. Using the pdf format solved two challeges. In terms of the steps covered in the guidebook, I decided to summarize the steps into short and quick step-by-step format. In order for the guidebook to visually resemble the IKEA guidebook, I made it in black and white, and using simple, easy to understand graphics, which are similar to the one IKEA uses in their guidebooks. 

    Originially, I had decided to use magnets as a way to secure the front-facing panels onto the scultpure. However, I ran into several issues installing the magnets, the main issue was the acoustics; when the speakers output vibrations because of loud music, the vibrations are enough to cause an unwanted vibration sound from the panels. So, to solve this problem, I decided to use normal wood screws to scure the panels. This solution offered, although less, but enough ease of removing/replacing of the panels, which was the inteded goal from the beginning. In addition to that, the screws offered enough pressure to secure the panels in place and without causing any unwanted vibrations or sounds. Lastly, after installing the panels, I had to install a single door in order to be able to access the inside of the device for troubleshooting and upgrades. 

    Tomorrow, we present the second iteration of the prototype and receive our second batch of critiques.

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Yesterday, we finally presented our second iterations of the prototypes that we built through this course. The initial response to the prototype I built was very good, the response to the QR code and the guidebook associated with it were great also. Overall, the iterations are made through the past two weeks were totally appropriate and effective. Users easily understood the aim of the prototype and found the guidebook very helpful in understanding the steps and the message behind it. Moreover, a very good point was mentioned, which is to ensure that a QR is used on all objects developed through this project, and the reason is that to keep the connection between them going and people aware of it. This connection with strengthen the project as a whole and jump starts a movement of upcycling amoung the maker community. I personally found this point extremely useful. 


    On the other hand, an unexpected idea was suggested to me during the feedback stage: to create a score system that translates the amount of recycled components to a simple score similar to the one used for credit scores. This idea is an elegant solution that allows me to use a combination of used and new components and turns that into a score that the users can see and perhaps try to beat. This also has the effect of creating almost a competition of who can create a 100/100 object made completely of recycled and upcycled components. An interesting addition to the project. 

    Also, another feedback I received after presenting the prototype was to find a framework for the materials to be used for the future prototypes. I am still unsure what this feedback means but I think that person was suggesting that I focus on choosing a few materials or components to work with and continue with a more focused but limited framework. I intend to still looking into the point, I believe it might offer some advantages for future prototypes, but depending on the level of limitation, it might or might not work.

<August.05.2019--Week-7--Entry-13----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Going through the process of fabrication for this prototyping course was extremely helpful in understanding what people can relate to and understand and what they don't. In addition to that, through this process I learned a lot about the process of making these prototypes and what I should focus more on and what I should spend less time and effort on. For example, after finishing this prototype, I realized that I did not visually document this stage very well. I did not take photos of the components which turned out to be a missing element of this prototype because I now believe that it must be very useful for users to see the components separately, photographed and documented, in order to relate the components together. Otherwise, the users cannot fully understand the variety of the components that went into the prototype and hence, after finishing the prototype, I had to illustrate the documentaiton process in order to have a visual aid for presentation ot the users. 

    Also, at the beginning of the process, I was a little lost on the framework that I should work within in order to build these series of prototypes. For example, earlier, I was planning to build a variety of functional objects that are upcycling older components to function. However, after building this and going through the building process, I realized that I need some context in terms of types of objects or functions that I should abide by and build within. I am still not sure about the what kind of limitations I want to set for myself during this journey but now I see the value of having some framing for the building process. Otherwise, the list of objects can be really long and really difficult because while speakers and sound equipment are relatively easy to work with, handling complex machines will requires extensive learning and experimenting for me to reach a point where I can manipulate them. So, I will continue to explore this angle further and analyze the benefits and disadvantages of narrowing down the focus or not. 

    On the other hand, which I've also mentioned before, I now realize the importance of setting the type of prototype from the start and abiding by it. In other words, deciding on a low-fidelity prototype can add a lot of value in terms of quick explorations versus slow and accurate fabrication process that relies a lot on how the audience receives the prototype and less on the learning that happens during and after the fabrication. So, I intend to explore this further and putting more importance on this step. 

    Also, I have expanded my view on the importance of useful feedback and now I'm able to see it more as a productive step rather than a finish line. It is an essential step in the iteration process and can contribute by adding otherwise unnoticed points. I made the mistake of considering the first exhibit of our prorotypes as a finish line and aimed at showing a finished prototype, I realized that showing an unfinished prototype can be more useful since it gives room for improvement and change, if relevent. 
    
    Overall, I have learned a lot during this course. It was mostly figuring out my strengths and weaknesses, which is important especially because we are starting a long and complex process of building through the coming few months. So, identifying those challenges at this point will give us the time to work on improving and taking advantge of those skills.
