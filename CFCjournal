Generating ideas for a new project can be a difficult and stressful process, and throughout years, we each develop our own ways and techniques tackling this challenge. There's been thousands of books and various writings by authors who feel they have achieved a reliable technique that could work for others. I believe we are all different and what might work for someone,  might not work for another. So, the best result we can hope for, is when we share our experiences and techniques, we get to learn from each other, and we get to adapt our own process rather than replace. Today's group exercise felt a lot like that. We each got to share our experiences not aiming for convincing others, but rather share with others and receive their response with a constructive environment. 

I've been a designer for the longer part of my life and I've developed of formed my own process, which is influenced and inspired by several things from my own background. For example, the techniques that I get inspired by growing up as a creative person are still there, however, grew over time and matured through new experiences in life and with others, peers and teachers. 

A common practice that is often used for generating ideas is sketching. I heard more than one person in my group mention sketching as a technique they use in order to visually observe their ideas and by extension generate new ideas. I personally use this technique often. I used to rely on sketching much more, but through experience, I learnt to be more efficient about it. For example, while before I used to sketch 50 or 60 different sketches, in variety of complexity, for a project and then use a method of elimination in order to get to the best result. While this may work for some projects, sketching for such a long time can be a waste of time, so, I adapt my process to involve a little more research and ideation, and then move to sketching stage that would require significantly less time and effort. 

Since my childhood, I have always been a "fixer". Going from taking old radios and electronics apart and attempting to assemble them again, I quickly gained the confidence to attempt to fix any malfunctioning electronic device at home. After that, I worked in my uncle electronics repair shop and spent most afternoons learning and fixing electronics. While I did not learn these skills using any books of formal teaching, my brain got comfortable with this type learning and doing. Until today, I rely on my improvisation abilities when learning new skills and tools, and in most cases, I quickly pick up the new challenge. 

Throughout my teenage, I spent most weekends of the sow and harvest seasons helping my grandfather, who's a farmer, in his farm. Spending time with farmers allowed me to observe and appreciate the way they treat their assets, especially equipment. This experience taught me that tools are important, and that tools can be utilized in many different ways, and in many cases, they can outlast their owner. In the farm, we throw nothing, we recycle everything, and if we cannot recycle it, we repurpose it. For example, when my grandmother wanted to throw away the old washing machine, we moved it to the farm, and there, my uncle was able to turn it to a small hydro-generator. Genius, yet doable. 

Understanding our experiences in our childhood and young adult life, we can decode and analyze our skills and our weaknesses. While I recognize my skills in making through improvising, or resourceful and multidisciplinary thinking, I also am able to identify foundational weaknesses like extensive literal research and writing. These, while not required in all disciplines, are vital to be able to formulate, present and defend a research thesis paper and project.
