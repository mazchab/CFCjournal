Generating ideas for a new project can be a difficult and stressful process, and throughout years, we each develop our own ways and techniques tackling this challenge. There's been thousands of books and various writings by authors who feel they have achieved a reliable technique that could work for others. I believe we are all different and what might work for someone,  might not work for another. So, the best result we can hope for, is when we share our experiences and techniques, we get to learn from each other, and we get to adapt our own process rather than replace. Today's group exercise felt a lot like that. We each got to share our experiences not aiming for convincing others, but rather share with others and receive their response with a constructive environment. 

I've been a designer for the longer part of my life and I've developed of formed my own process, which is influenced and inspired by several things from my own background. For example, the techniques that I get inspired by growing up as a creative person are still there, however, grew over time and matured through new experiences in life and with others, peers and teachers. 

A common practice that is often used for generating ideas is sketching. I heard more than one person in my group mention sketching as a technique they use in order to visually observe their ideas and by extension generate new ideas. I personally use this technique often. I used to rely on sketching much more, but through experience, I learnt to be more efficient about it. For example, while before I used to sketch 50 or 60 different sketches, in variety of complexity, for a project and then use a method of elimination in order to get to the best result. While this may work for some projects, sketching for such a long time can be a waste of time, so, I adapt my process to involve a little more research and ideation, and then move to sketching stage that would require significantly less time and effort. 

Since my childhood, I have always been a "fixer". Going from taking old radios and electronics apart and attempting to assemble them again, I quickly gained the confidence to attempt to fix any malfunctioning electronic device at home. After that, I worked in my uncle electronics repair shop and spent most afternoons learning and fixing electronics. While I did not learn these skills using any books of formal teaching, my brain got comfortable with this type learning and doing. Until today, I rely on my improvisation abilities when learning new skills and tools, and in most cases, I quickly pick up the new challenge. 

Throughout my teenage, I spent most weekends of the sow and harvest seasons helping my grandfather, who's a farmer, in his farm. Spending time with farmers allowed me to observe and appreciate the way they treat their assets, especially equipment. This experience taught me that tools are important, and that tools can be utilized in many different ways, and in many cases, they can outlast their owner. In the farm, we throw nothing, we recycle everything, and if we cannot recycle it, we repurpose it. For example, when my grandmother wanted to throw away the old washing machine, we moved it to the farm, and there, my uncle was able to turn it to a small hydro-generator. Genius, yet doable. 

Understanding our experiences in our childhood and young adult life, we can decode and analyze our skills and our weaknesses. While I recognize my skills in making through improvising, or resourceful and multidisciplinary thinking, I also am able to identify foundational weaknesses like extensive literal research and writing. These, while not required in all disciplines, are vital to be able to formulate, present and defend a research thesis paper and project.

Deciding what type of prototype would be beneficial for a thesis project is essential for the research journey to be completed and relevant. In today's class, we went over the types of prototypes that we can consider for our thesis research and projects and since each research is a subject matter, we each find value in different prototypes for this specific journey. For example, examining my research topic and the message I want my audience to get from this project, I have to break down and analyze what each type of prototype can do for this project and how it can benefit me and the audience. 

E-waste is a massive issue, and I personally will not aim or propose how to solve it. However, my exploration will allow me to understand how I can be part of this solution and my experience and journey will be intended to inspire the audience to figure out their own steps in order to be part of the solution. Hence, the type of prototype I decide to go with will be absolutely essential to the audience and to the message. For example, a low-fidelity prototype, while it allows me to experiment extensively with several ideas and concepts, it might seem unattractive to the audience. Also, low-fidelity prototypes allows for the message to be abstract, or hidden, rather than visible and clear. In my case, I believe I need to build several low-fidelity prototypes in order to understand and decide what kind of message and how to deliver that message. 

On other hand, a high-fidelity prototype, while inline with my style and interests, requires extensive knowledge and effort to perfect and ensure looks good and attractive. However, it will attract audience and is more likely to have an effect on them than a low-fidelity one. This type of prototype is what I'm interested in for a final delivery, because I believe in the aesthetics of things and I believe people are too. Also, the message intended to be delivered requires a fully-functional object that does what it is supposed to do, otherwise, it can still be considered junk that people might throw in the trash, or in their old electronics drawer. 

An outcome centred prototype seems like the sweet-spot between the first two types. An outcome centred prototype requires the building of several low-fidelity prototypes, however, with the intention of figuring out and perfecting the final prototype which will be delivered and presented. This seems like what would work in my project. Using this method, I get the chance to use my prototype building journey, as a research or exploration, into what will be delivered in the future. A process of exploration can be very beneficial to the project because the designer gets to explore every possible outcome and every possible implication of their decisions without the need to wait until the last step of the process. Definitely a process more inline with my personal process and more inline with my intended outcome for this project. 

A process centred prototype is also a very attached solution to my project. This type of prototype allows for the explorations and the outcomes to be recorded and used in the research section of the thesis. While it might offer some benefits to my project, this method is more research-focused than object-focused, which is where I intend to focus my thesis. However, I do plan to utilize some of the approaches in this method in order to refine my research and add some personal contribution to the thesis research document. 

A context-centred approach is a big-picture approach. A very beneficial method in order to keep the audience focused on the general idea rather than dive into small more specific ideas, which might confuse the audience. 

While I intend to use some of those approaches through my thesis research and project, I find it very useful to know about them in order to know which ones to avoid.

Presenting our initial prototype ideas was very helpful in udnerstanding and structuring what is to be expected and aimed for during this class. Having access to professional and peer review, to present and listen to feedback is vital, especially because it is the first one we receive so far. So, after presenting a couple of ideas I had for the prototype, I received some confusion regarding the concept and it required additional explanation. This is very helpful for me since a practical thesis should be explainable in one sentence, which is a work-in-progress until now. 

My aim for this prototype is not to build something challenging or new. My aim was much more basic than that at this point. Starting the exploratin into what kind of object will successfully compliment my thesis research is going to be full mistakes and experimentation. So, I don't expect to get it right from the first time, nor the second, probably not even the third, and listening to my peers' own explorations confirmed my choice. So, for this prototype I decided to choose from three options: A. The first idea is an electronic dice device that is used in countless boardgames. It is not the most advanced or new idea, but I want to experiment with the playfulness of this project and possible explore a less serious more fun approach to creation and recycling. B. The second idea I proposed is a stereo system recycled from discarded audio devices like speakers and car radios. Although this idea is not as playful as the first, it does however, bring music into the project, which another big interest of mine. C. The third idea is an LED matrix compiled from several different discarded devices' LEDs and put together to create a visual experience that can continuously remind the viewer of e-waste. 

Although non of the ideas is presenting something new or never-been-done-before. However, they do offer a simple and elegant presentation of the problem and a possible solution. Design is essential in the world today. Designers can have an amazing impact on the long run. We continue to see today, evidence and implications of design decisions made several generations ago, for example, the Star, developed by Xerox, has impacted the way we interact and view computers today. The concept of a desktop, a mouse, a keyboard, etc were all introduced by Xerox in the early 80s, and it was a design experiment, that might or might not be the best way to design a computer interface. So, bearing that in mind, we have to acknowledge the influence design can have on the world and start using the skills and advantages of design-thinking to create speculative solutions for the future. 

I noticed some of the remarks I received regarding my prototype, was a the futuristic remark. While most student proposed AR or VR or hologram etc, which are futuristic technologies, I wanted to refocus my study to a different futuristic view, one that does not necessarily take the status-quo as acceptable, and attempts to propose a different one. A research and building venture that can refine our relationship with technology to a healthier one or atleast help some of us identify it. My view of the future is not a world full of AR and wearables and gadgets only, but it is also the mountains of waste all of those gadgets will be one day.
